Example code for performing [WS-Security UserNameToken](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/13392/wss-v1.1-spec-pr-UsernameTokenProfile-01.htm) authentication for OLSA Web Services, utilising OpenSSL and PHP SoapClient

Minimum PHP version that supports TLS 1.2 is PHP 5.5.19 with OpenSSL 1.0.1

# Config
In the config.php you need to enter the OLSA endpoint url, customerid and shared secret

In PHP.INI you need to ensure the SOAP client and OPENSSL extensions are enabled.

# SOAP Client Code Details
